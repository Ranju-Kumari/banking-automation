An End-to-End automation framework for demo bank website - https://parabank.parasoft.com/parabank/index.htm

I've used the following tech stack in this framework:
- **Selenium**: For automating web browser interaction.
- **Java**: Programming language used for writing test scripts.
- **TestNG**: For managing test cases, test execution, and reporting.
- **Gradle**: For build automation and managing dependencies.
